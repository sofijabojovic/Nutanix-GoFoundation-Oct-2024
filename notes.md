## Why Go?
- Simple Language
    - ONLY 25 keywords
    - No access modifiers (NO public/private/protected)
    - No classes (only structs)
    - No inheritance (only composition)
    - No reference types (everything is a value)
    - No pointer arithmatic
    - No exceptions (only errors)
    - No try-catch-finally construct
    - No implicit type conversion
- Compiled to machine code
    - Has tooling support for cross compilation
- Performance
    - Close to hardware
    - Compile to machine code
    - Equivalent to C++
- Concurrency Support
    - Managed Concurrency (vs OS Thread based concurrency)
    - Goroutines - concurrency model
        - Cheap (4 KB)
        - Efficient (minimizes context switch)
    - Concurrency support is built in the language itself
        - "go" keyword, channel ("chan") data type, channel ("<-") operator, for-range, select-case
        - Standard library
            - "sync" package
            - "sync/atomic" package
